// Functions

- Reusable code
 - We define a chunk of code that we can execute at a later point
 - Functions are used all the time

 - Every method is a Functions

 - Arguemnts are inputs we place in the ()

    - Function Example

    function greet(person) {
    var person = 'Ben'
    console.log(`Hi, ${person}!`)
    
}
greet()

- ** Var will only work within the function
    - Both let & const will not work if I change var to either of these


- Here is an alternative to this:

function greeting(name) {
    console.log(`Hi ${name}`)
}
greeting('Emily')



** When adding in functions start with a total = 0 at the start of a function **


** Leveling up our Functions ** 

- higher order functions can take a function as an argument even if it is outside of the original function
    - higher functions can run lower functions as well as functions above itself
